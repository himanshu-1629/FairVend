This project aims to support the underprivileged by directly connecting them with donors. The website displays nearby vending machines where people in need can use a special colour coded card. Depending on the cardâ€™s colour, they can receive special discounts on the required item. These discounts are made possible through contributions from donors who have the capital to help through the website.
